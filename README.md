<b> Phase 2 - Individual project for EDA

Clothing Library or OpShop for Pre-school Childrens Clothing</b>

People can donate clothing as a gift or a loan item. They will be thanked for gifts (generate a thankful email) and provided with credits in exchange for loan items. They can then use those credits to borrow items of clothing. They will be able to search by age/gender/style of clothing they want to 'borrow'.

 to see who returns clothing in poor condition? i.e. items needing removed from library after client borrowed.
